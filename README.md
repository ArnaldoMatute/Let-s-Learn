# Let's Learn

[Let-s-learn](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn) is repository of a collection of exercises from the different courses I have taught at Juan de Castellanos University in Tunja, Colombia for the Eletronics Engineering Programme. 

## Machine Learning 
The Notebook [KNN1.ipynb](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/KNN1.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook with Python code that shows how to build a K-Nearest-Neighbours Classifier with Scikit Learn for an example of random data in a "chess-board-like" squared distribution. 

The notebook [NN_fromTheSratch.ipynb](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/NN_FromTheScratch.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook with Python code that shows shows how to create and train a Neural Network form the scratch. Layers was instanced with a defined class "neural_layer". Functions for execution and training based on Backpropagations with Gradient Descent are also there. This example considers a random data in a "chess-board-like" squared distribution.

The notebook [NN_fromTheSratchII.ipynb](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/NN_FromTheScratchII.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook with Python code that shows how to create and train a Neural Network form the scratch. Layers was instanced with a defined class "neural_layer".  Functions for execution and training based on Backpropagations with Gradient Descent are also there. This example considers a random data in circle distribution using make_circles() from Scikit Learn.

## Advanced Maths

The file [series_pulsos2.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/series_pulsos2.m) is a Mathworks Matlab code that shows how the more terms are considered in the partial sum of a Fourier Series, the closer the approximation is to the original periodic function. The file [generate_pulses.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/generate_pulses.m) plots an original squared periodic function and [generate_sawtooth.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/generate_sawtooth.m) does the same for a Sawtooth like function. [FS_pulses.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/FS_pulse.m) and [FS_Sawtooth.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/FS_sawtooth.m) calculates the partial sum of each Fourier Series for a parameter `N`.   

## Digital Signals Processing 

The file [dft.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/dft.m) is a Mathworks Matlab code that shows how Spectrum resolution grows as a consequence of Zero-Padding. The more zeros are concatenated next to the original discrete signal, the more resolution the spectrum has as a consequence of increasing the period N.

The file [filtering_comparison.m](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/filtering_comparison.m) is a Mathworks Matlab code that shows an arbitrary signal being filtered, in the middle graphs, by a set Blackmann-Harris FIR lowpass filters of 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th and 64th order. Likewise, the bottom graphs shows the  equivalent effect for a set ofButterworth IIR low pass filter for the same list of orders. The signal in the time domain are graphed al the left and spectra are shown in the right. The normalized cuttoff Frecuency for all filters is 0.118.  

## Numerical Methods (This couser has not been offered this semester)

Some coding made in Mathworks Matlab or Python are also included to teach about [Newton-Raphson Method](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/NR.py) to solve non-linear equations and also for ODEs ([Euler](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/euler_2nd_Order.py) and [Heun](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/Let-s-Learn/blob/master/HEUN_METHOD_2_ORDER.m) methods)
